## Philosophy

In our daily, techies spend their time mostly in the internet, sometimes, for works and sometimes wasting the time. Sometimes we feel that there is a need of something that will give you an ayah daily to keep you up with your your faith in islam and get more stronger in your faith. AyahBot's main purpose is to give you a handy solution to reminding you with a quran ayah everyday at your convenient time. Developers at AyahBot team made it open-source for the easier and fast development of the bot. That's why, you can also check the code and make sure that we are not doing anything with your information.

In Shaa Allah, AyahBot will help you greatly in your trying to understanding al-quran's meaning on a regular basis. We request you to keep us in your dua.

## Commands

As a discord bot, AyahBot also its own commands for making your tasks easier. They are for various purposes, from scheduling to even printing any ayah from quran. You can learn more about these commands in our [wiki](https://github.com/AyahBot-Dev/AyahBot-Discord/wiki/Commands) page. They are clearly given there with proper instructions of how to use them.
